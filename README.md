## RecallMirror Minecraft mod

**DOWNLOADS** *(Minecraft 1.12.2)*

Version 1.3.2 - Current



**Version 1.3.1** - [Download](https://github.com/GodGMN/RecallMirror/raw/master/RecallMirror-1.3.1.jar)

* Published to Curseforge since I feel it's bug-free and more polished now.
* Removed the Block of Literal Shit. It was put in the game as a test and joke block. It doesn't fit this mod and it didn't have any usage or even proper textures/properties.

## **HOW TO USE THIS MOD**


It adds three items:

## **Portal Scroll**

**This item teleports you to your bed or world spawn.**

Single use Recall Mirrors, basically.

## **Recall Mirror**

**An item that will teleport you to your bed or world spawn.**

This item teleports you to your bed or world spawn. Infinite uses.

## **Nether Recall Mirror**

**Improved Recall Mirror.**

 It can also teleport you back to your last location before going to bed/spawn. Infinite uses.
 
 If it's ready to bring you to your **bed**, it will display this texture ![Nether recall mirror texture 1](https://imgur.com/cfEnWbT.png), if it's ready to bring you back to your last location, it will look like this ![Nether recall mirror texture 2](https://imgur.com/nM9CVFR.png)
 
 You can also clean the mirror putting it in your crafting table (The inventory 2x2 one will do). This will remove any stored coordinates so the item can bring you back to bed.

## **Changelog**

**Version 1.3.2** - **Current**

* Completely removed the Block of Literal Shit.
* Removed unused classes.
* Items are now useable in all dimension.

**Version 1.3.1**

* Published to Curseforge since I feel it's bug-free and more polished now.
* Removed the Block of Literal Shit. It was put in the game as a test and joke block. It doesn't fit this mod and it didn't have any usage or even proper textures/properties.

**Version 1.3.0**

* Added a texture change if the Nether Recall Mirror is ready to bring you back to your old location
* Added a recipe to get a Nether Recall Mirror putting another one in the crafting grid. This will clean any old coordinates in the item, making it go to your bed or spawn again.
* Changed the recipe for the Nether Recall Mirror. Now needs four extra diamonds.

**Version 1.2.1**

* Fixed Portal Scroll recipe so it doesn't overlap the "Blueprint" Buildcraft recipe.

**Version 1.2.0**

* Portal Scrolls now work as a single use Recall Mirror.
* The Nether Recall Mirror has been updated and now works as an improved Recall Mirror that can teleport you back to your original location.
* The crafting needs to be more expensive since the upgrade from Recall Mirror to Nether Recall Mirror is pretty much for free.
* Since the mod is now 100% working without any game-breaking bug, it's out of beta for now. It still has room for improvement.

**Version beta 1.1.1**

* Added lore on the Nether Mirror to display extra info like depth so you can know if you were in a cave or in the surface for example.

**Version beta 1.1.0**

* Added Nether Mirrors. They let you go back to your last Recall Mirror teleport position.

**Version beta 1.0.1**

* Fixed a bug when using the Recall Mirror without a bed.

**Version beta 1.0.0**

* Mod published. Portal Scrolls are not working so they are purely cosmetics for item frames. The block of literal shit doesn't have any property yet but you can craft and place it.

**How do I set up version number?**

No one asked but I'm curious about how do others set their version number. For me it's simple: the first number is reserved for big updates. Will probably stay in 1 forever. The second number is the actual update version, whenever I add something new, it will grow by one. The third and last number grows by one everytime I fix something like a bug or I update a description. Goes back to zero with new "second number" updates.

What does this mean to you? Probably nothing, but if you are in version, let's say 1.4.2 and latest is 1.4.4 I have probably fixed some descriptions or bugs. If latest is for example 1.5.0, you're probably missing out a new item or functionality.
